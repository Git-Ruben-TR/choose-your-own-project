# Choose Your Own Project - Credit Card Churn

I analyze and create a system to detect customers at risk of churn from a bank using the BankChurners database and by training three models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Binomial Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

BankChurners.csv is the database to be used.

choose-your-own.R - loads the BankChurners database, transforms the data, generates multiple graphs, and trains and presents the results of the three models.

choose-your-own.Rmd - uses the code in choose-your-own.R to analyze and present a report in the form of an Rmd file.

choose-your-own.pdf - report in the form of a PDF knit from my Rmd file.

**To ensure that the code works, BankChurners.csv and the R files must be in the same working directory.**
